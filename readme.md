Originally this was intended to transcribe podcasts in order to be able to feed neural networks to regenerate similar content.

Due to missing quality of the obtained text sources from the transcriptions, this has turned into a text generation Project that relies on written text sources.

The nginx container runs as server for the site.

The predictor container contains the model.
